# Content Strategy in a Box

This is Content Strategy in a Box, a set of exercises you can work
through to develop a basic content plan for your documentation. It
is designed for small development teams that don't have access to
a dedicated content strategist or documentation professional, and
based off of years of experience running open source documentation
sprints.

To unbox your own content strategy:

1. Fork this repository from `https://github.com/shaunix/csiab`.

2. Start with `strategy.md`. Fill in placeholder text.
   Instructions are interspersed using Markdown block quotes.
   Feel free to delete those.

3. Proceeed through the rest of the files in the order they are
   listed in `strategy.md`. Fill in placeholder text and delete
   instructions as you please.

4. This repository contains a Makefile, a Ruby template, and
   some CSS. You can build an HTML version by running the
   command `make`. This requires that you have `kramdown`
   installed. Or use your favorite Markdown tools.

5. Feel free to delete this README from your repository if it
   gets in your way. It is not part of your strategy.
