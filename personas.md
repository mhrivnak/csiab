# Users and Personas

> Let's think about your users. To write effective documentation,
> you have to know who your audience is. We'll create some personas
> that will help you identify objectives, goals, and tasks.
>
> Start by lumping your users into three to five broad groups. If
> you make server software, these groups might be people who deploy
> the software, people who use the deployed software, people who
> develop against your public API, and people who develop the
> software itself. Feel free to change these groups to whatever
> best suits your project.
>
> Within each group, create three to five personas. While these
> personas might share the same high-level objectives, they may
> have different backgrounds or skill sets that affect what kind
> of instruction you need to provide. Usually, each deliverable
> will be geared towards a user group, although you might have
> getting started guides geared towards specific personas.
